0,"- So today's agenda, we're gonna start with why am I talking China and Vietnam. We're then gonna talk about reform in China in the period leading up to the 4th of June, 1989 which is the Tiananmen Square massacre. We'll then talk about Tiananmen in the 1990s that will lead us into a discussion of what I'm calling the sequencing debate of political and economic reform. Once it was clear that communism was gonna be replaced by capitalism,",8.11,41.73,33.638999999999996,4eUS8trd_yI
1,"there was a huge debate about, well, is it better to have political reform first or economic reform first. We'll try to do them together and we'll talk about that sequencing debate which will lead us into a larger discussion of what since the 1950s has been known as modernization theory. The thesis that economic modernization will eventually produce demand for",45.73,69.72,26.450000000000003,4eUS8trd_yI
2,"and the establishment of democracy and that will then leave us to think about the future. So, China and Vietnam Today. - [Narrator] China so far has built the equivalent of Europe's entire housing stock in just 15 years. In November 2015, Beijing replaced the substantially larger 1300 ton Sanyuan Bridge in just 43 hours. Between 1996 and 2016, China has built 2.6 million miles of roads including 70,000 miles of highways",72.18,109.55,36.986000000000004,4eUS8trd_yI
3,"connecting 95% of the country's villages and overtaking the US as the country with the most extensive highway system by almost 50%. Over the past decade, China has constructed the world's longest high speed rail network. 12,000 miles of rail lines that carry passengers between cities, at speeds up to 180 miles per hour. China now has more high speed rail tracks",112.28,135.52,25.740000000000002,4eUS8trd_yI
4,"than the rest of the world combined. - So that's one of any number of video clips one could pick to just give a snapshot of the incredible transformation of the Chinese economy over the last couple of decades and indeed, over the last decade, I went to Beijing last year for the first time in about 12 years and 12 years ago, there were lots of potholes in the streets,",138.02,168.28799999999998,33.272999999999996,4eUS8trd_yI
5,"there was still rickshaws on the highways. You go to Beijing today, it's just miles and miles of skyscrapers and every conceivable multinational is there. It looks like just West Los Angeles times a hundred. So you can't overstate and I will put some statistics up in a little while, but the economic explosion in China since the 1970s has been phenomenal. And then here's another snapshot versus Vietnam.",173.81,217.75,39.293,4eUS8trd_yI
6,"- If you're talking about the 80s what Vietnam look like. You go to cities, you didn't see the light, electricity cut, no car in the street. Vietnam was so isolated from the world. - [Narrator] With the Doi Moi economic reforms of 1986, the government hoped to move toward what is now called a socialist-oriented market economy. When the Vietnamese government asked for hands-on advice,",223.22,251.09,25.945999999999998,4eUS8trd_yI
7,"the IMF did not refuse the call. (speaking in foreign language) - If you use the analogy of Vietnam's economy as a eagle flying up, there are two wings. One is internal institutional reform, and the other is opening to trade. - [Narrator] Free to start their own companies, the Vietnamese people created more than 30,000 private businesses",254.11,287.82,25.238999999999997,4eUS8trd_yI
8,"in the first 10 years, spurring growth that averaged 7% throughout the 1990s. - If you look back in the late 80s and early 90s we had the first FDI law ever which opened up the opportunity for newly established private firms to engage international trade. - And that was complemented with a major push to attract foreign direct investment into Vietnam. - [Narrator] The economy has grown at about 7% per year",290.46,322.01,30.723000000000006,4eUS8trd_yI
9,"since 1990, second globally only to China. - So these are the two most successful examples of post communist systems that have remained authoritarian but have been transforming their economies into capitalist arrangements. And that differentiates them from the other post-communist systems that have retained authoritarian rule if we think about North Korea,",324.74,358.03,34.133,4eUS8trd_yI
10,"or we think about Cuba, they have not transformed their economies. So this is one thing that differentiates them from the other post-communist authoritarian systems, post-communist economies retaining communist authoritarian political systems. And they account for a large part of the economic success in the world in the last decade just to take one or two decades. Just to take one example,",360.24,395.86,35.66300000000001,4eUS8trd_yI
11,"one of the encouraging stories of our time is if you if you take the long view of things, number of people and even the percentage of the population both living in extreme poverty has really gone down over the past two centuries and much of that decline has come in the last few decades. Of course, this is a worldwide indicator. But if you look at what is accounting for most of this decline, you can see that the main action has been in East Asia.",401.23400000000004,437.98,34.732000000000006,4eUS8trd_yI
12,"So the this is the blue line up here where poverty again, this is number of people living on a less than $1.25 a day, which is a World Bank's definition of extreme poverty. So, most of the changes of course, have come in the developing world. But if you compare East Asia, for example, to Africa, East Asia is by far the lion's share of the reduction in extreme poverty. Now of course, not all of that is the is China and Vietnam.",442.84,476.0,35.813,4eUS8trd_yI
13,"There're countries like South Korea that have massively improved. There are other countries in that part of the world not to mention Singapore, where poverty rates have decreased massively. Nonetheless, China and Vietnam are relatively impressive stories on this front as well. This is a picture of reductions in poverty in Vietnam and if I'd had gone back before 2010, the numbers would have been higher up there as well.",479.64,513.34,36.85,4eUS8trd_yI
14,"But you can see, even in this last difficult decade, and despite the fact that ethnic minorities within Vietnam are not doing as well as as others, we're seeing very low rates of people living in poverty in Vietnam. China, you can see the head count living below the official poverty line is the red line. The head count below 1.9 US dollars a day is the green line.",516.65,547.2,32.400000000000006,4eUS8trd_yI
15,"Again, you can see massive reductions in poverty by many estimates they vary, but many estimates say that since the reforms in China ushered in in the late 1970s, somewhere between 400 million and half a billion people have moved out of poverty. Now, there's another line on this chart, which I don't believe, which is the Gini coefficient which is a measure of inequality",555.0,587.25,32.866,4eUS8trd_yI
16,"and I believe that the inequality in China has gone up a good deal more. If you look at here, this is comparing the top and bottom quintile. But again, this is data provided by the Chinese government, you can see that in terms of per capita income, they're showing an increase inequality from three times to about eight times and land and consumption, less of a change. So I would just say two things about these statistics,",591.13,625.1,36.373,4eUS8trd_yI
17,"these are based on Chinese government statistics. My guess is that the inequality in Chinese is a lot higher, and particularly this is comparing quintiles that's the top 20%. But just as in the US, and just as in many other capitalist countries that we'll talk about later in the course, if you look at the top 5%, the top 1%, or the top .1%, you're gonna see massive increases in inequality",631.658,658.199,29.466,4eUS8trd_yI
18,"and that puts on the table a dilemma that's gonna be worth thinking about as we progress through the course and talk about some other countries. Which is that while inequality within countries just about anywhere in the world has gone up over the last four decades, worldwide, global inequality has actually come down, and the number of people living in poverty has come down dramatically as we've seen.",662.37,689.08,28.89,4eUS8trd_yI
19,"But if you read say the Millennium Goals or you go to the World Economic Forum meetings, which I have done from time to time, you'll see politician after politician and policy wonk after policy wonk standing there saying, ""We need policies to reduce poverty and inequality."" It's like almost one word, poverty and inequality is one word, but what we're seeing here",692.85,716.8,26.7,4eUS8trd_yI
20,"is something that' gonna come back to us in multiple ways during the course. It's not obvious that all good things go together. And it may well be the case that the price of reducing inequality, the price of reducing poverty is tolerating significant increases in inequality, we'll have to think about those trade offs in various settings. In any event in both China and in Vietnam,",719.55,746.43,29.191,4eUS8trd_yI
21,"you've seen massive decreases in poverty, big increases inequality in not as high by most measures in Vietnam again, now it's hard to know what statistics to believe on these matters but most scholars seem to think there's less inequality in Vietnam than in China. So the first answer why are we talking about China and Vietnam today is that by virtually any measure",749.93,777.44,26.965999999999998,4eUS8trd_yI
22,"they have been economically successful. But then the second and in some ways more interesting reason we're gonna look at them is they challenge a lot of accepted wisdom about capitalism, democracy and the relations between them because here we have two very repressive authoritarian systems, transforming their economies into successful capitalist ones. So that's the puzzle we're gonna be wrestling with",780.46,807.3,28.373000000000005,4eUS8trd_yI
23,"for the rest of today's class in one form or another. So let's think about what was happening in China before Tiananmen. After Mao's death in 1978, things were gonna change very rapidly, just to give you a sense, up until the end of the Cultural Revolution in China, this is a picture comparing Chinese and Japanese per capita GDP.",811.54,845.18,32.383,4eUS8trd_yI
24,"And as you can see, this is a period of explosive economic growth in Japan after World War Two, of course, from a very low base because the whole economy had been destroyed. When people talk about the Japanese miracle, it's a little bit misleading. If we took this back to 1925, this line would have come down because of the collapse produced during the war.",847.02,871.86,24.536,4eUS8trd_yI
25,"It's a recreation to some degree of what it existed before the war, but nothing like the levels that were seen in years afterward. But as you can see, per capita GDP in China was basically flat. There was no economic development to speak of. 1978 Mao is now dead. The third plenum of the Communist Party Central Committee, led vice premier soon to be premier, Deng Xiaoping",876.65,906.99,31.298000000000002,4eUS8trd_yI
26,"calls for officials to start liberating their thinking, to start seeking truth from facts. An ironic statement perhaps in light of our own discussions of fake news and manipulation of the truth that we're coping with today, but to innovate and experiment in the economy, and officials were instructed, this is when they started, China had been very closed and inward looking and they began going in large numbers abroad,",911.75,946.8,34.563,4eUS8trd_yI
27,"they started applying for courses at places like MIT business school, they started trying to learn from other development models and this is gonna be the beginning of experimentation with new forms of capitalism. This is also when the big special economic zones in China were created, these massive islands of experimenting with capitalism, if you like, most of the world's special economic zones",950.93,986.903,34.61,4eUS8trd_yI
28,"and we'll talk a bit more about them in other countries later are sort of industrial parks. They are 40 or 50 firms, they get some preferential tax treatment and the idea is to attract foreign capital. The ones being set up in China were enormous, they were sort of giant cities with schools and shops and people lived in them in their entire lives. So the idea was to experiment with capitalist economics",989.75,1019.58,34.040000000000006,4eUS8trd_yI
29,"in self contained ways. This is also when they start opening up to foreign direct investment. This is when companies like Cummins truck engines come to China, one of the biggest multinationals in China today started in the in the late 1970s, early 1980s. And so this seemed to be a little bit like the Prague Spring. And indeed, in the late 1970s,",1024.16,1051.58,29.51,4eUS8trd_yI
30,"people started talking about the Beijing spring and there was much more criticism of the government tolerated, people started publishing things that you would have been thrown in prison for five years or even three years earlier, and there was something of a thaw, there was something called the Democracy Wall in the Shidong district of Beijing was created, a kind of graffiti wall if you like",1055.83,1084.597,30.16,4eUS8trd_yI
31,"on which people published criticisms of the government, but the vast majority of the political criticism was backward looking. It was criticism of the Cultural Revolution, criticism of Mao, criticism of what had been done in the past, mistakes that had been made in the past. And of course, that wasn't gonna stay that way and so before long,",1088.23,1114.84,26.379,4eUS8trd_yI
32,"the Democracy Wall protesters started shifting their attention from attacking the past to attacking the current leadership in China. Again, a lot of demands now for more democracy. Wei Jinsheng was a protester who came out and made very strong criticisms of the government and this went on until late 1980s, early 1981 and then there was a lot of pushback from the regime. And so much of the 1980s were this era of testing, political testing,",1118.09,1165.93,38.778999999999996,4eUS8trd_yI
33,"by student movements, there were reorganization of student groups on Chinese campuses, there was a lot of criticism of the government interspersed with pushback. So Deng, came out and made very clear that when he was talking about experimentation with reform, he was talking about economic reform, he was not talking about reforming the political system and he reaffirmed what he called party rule",1170.26,1200.54,31.55,4eUS8trd_yI
34,"and the socialist path. He focused on technical questions. His four modernizations had to do with agriculture, the industrial economy, the military, and technology, technological innovation. They started attacking what they called Spiritual Pollution. There was an anti-Spiritual Pollution campaign in 1983, and there was an anti-Bourgeois Liberalization campaign in 1987. And Hu-Yaobang who had been a member",1203.75,1236.01,34.025999999999996,4eUS8trd_yI

So it was this period of back and forth, but a lot of growing protests nonetheless, in the 1980s. And it was also a time when the economy wasn't doing that well, particularly for consumers in urban areas, we saw a lot of inflation",1241.38,1270.27,29.072999999999997,4eUS8trd_yI
36,"and that led to austerity programs, cutbacks on spending by the government, which produced further escalation of protests although the economic reforms continued. So if you look at foreign direct investment in China, you can see it's very low there, but it's going to accelerate dramatically over the 1990s. So then, in 1989, in the summer of 1989, if somebody had said,",1272.68,1311.53,36.76,4eUS8trd_yI

39,"As the afternoon wears on here, the crowd gets bigger and bigger hoping that this protest will produce results, that the government will respond to the students demand for meaningful dialogue and begin to implement the kind of genuine reforms as opposed to cosmetic reforms that the students want. - So these protests were going on and it soon became clear that the regime was not going tolerate them",1371.27,1397.47,27.552999999999997,4eUS8trd_yI

Competition within the state sector and between the state sector and the private sector, so they created big state owned enterprises, particularly in China, but they introduce competition among them and they required them to compete in the private sector and they shut down inefficient state companies. It should be said that it's very difficult",2247.25,2281.4,33.053,4eUS8trd_yI
64,"to get a grip on the differences between the state sector and the private sector that means very much in China, partly because the many of the private sector companies get funding from state banks, but also because many of the top leadership of private sector firms are members of the Communist Party, and have to be members of the Communist Party. And so that raises the question",2284.81,2315.72,31.363000000000007,4eUS8trd_yI

Again, this is pointed to by many scholars that this export basic producing for foreign markets, manufacturing goods for foreign markets has been extremely successful.

In China while you can't attack people for political reasons, you can attack officials for being inefficient and corrupt.

And so the parts of the economy in which the foreign firms are big",2455.68,2482.86,26.963,4eUS8trd_yI
70,"have been where there's been a lot of demand for the creation of courts to resolve disputes.

80,"And, so how do think about that. Well, there's some questions to wonder about with respect just to the economies. One is that since 2008, we have seen a resurgence in the growth of the state sectors of these economies. This is partly, as I intimated, at right at the beginning of today's lecture, that now that the Washington Consensus is in bad odor, people are now talking about the Beijing Consensus.",2806.32,2835.56,32.17,4eUS8trd_yI

82,"from the model that was being purveyed in the Washington Consensus. And to the extent that the state sector is gonna be less efficient, that raises questions about how sustainable these growth rates are.

83,"Then there's what Steinfeld in that ""Playing Our Game"" book that I put on there calls, the smile curve of profitability, and so, this is the idea which he actually takes from somebody calls Stan Shi. This is the idea that if you look at where the biggest profitability in manufacturing comes from, most of it is either at the R&D phase, research and development upstream,",2905.29,2937.63,31.406000000000002,4eUS8trd_yI

It's people who come up with the basic technologies, make a lot of money, and then the people who put it together, do the marketing, make a lot of money. So the solid curve here, what it's telling you is that there's not that much money to be made in the manufacturing, this is just low wage labor",2941.23,2965.49,26.47,4eUS8trd_yI
85,"and these are these people working on assembly lines. That's not the source of great profitability but that has been where most of the economic action has been in these economies. The dotted line is that realizing that the Chinese have started to try and move further up the smiley curve in both directions, so they tried to get more involved in research and development and more involved in marketing and sales.",2967.7,2997.61,31.557000000000002,4eUS8trd_yI

87,and so it's not clear that they're gonna be able to continue to be profitable. Picking winners. Economists always criticize central planning because governments pick winners and governments don't know how to pick winners. They don't know where are gonna be the successful parts of the economy. That is less of a problem in the early stages of industrialization.,3024.96,3053.12,24.955999999999996,4eUS8trd_yI

And so it may well be that the mechanism",3108.44,3143.23,35.225,4eUS8trd_yI

In Vietnam, they had almost a separation of powers system with different leaders, responsible for different parts of the political and legal system and that also seems to be breaking down or at least under strain from reports that it's possible to get. I already mentioned Yuhua Wang's point",3147.22,3175.26,30.12,4eUS8trd_yI
92,"that to the extent that the rule of law in the economy was dependent on demand from the foreign sector, that might be going away as foreign investment as a proportion of the Chinese economy is actually shrinking. And given the trade wars that we are now in, they might be shrinking a lot further than we talked about before. And so that plus the leadership changes might mean that",3177.58,3201.39,26.980000000000004,4eUS8trd_yI

Making a Nike running shoe is split into about 35 different tasks, one person is cutting the little pieces",3393.08,3420.28,23.287000000000003,4eUS8trd_yI

It is long been conventional wisdom that democratic systems are incompatible with state-run economies.

And so today's agenda is to understand this reorientation of the parties of the left",856.1,885.82,32.8,T3-VlQu3iRM
252,"and then think about their place in the broader scheme that we are developing as the course goes a long. Our agenda is gonna have three parts to it, I'm gonna start by revisiting the comments I made about distributive politics or the psychology of distributive politics in a little more depth than I did last time. And the reason is I've had a number of questions about it, and it's really important. It's gonna be important later in the course",889.368,918.07,31.072000000000003,T3-VlQu3iRM
253,"and it's gonna be important for today's lecture. So I'm gonna reprise what I said about that and extend it a little bit. Then we're gonna come to the heart of the matter and talk about unions, left of center parties and the median voter as they played out in this period. And then finally we're gonna talk more generally about distributive politics in two-party systems such as Britain and the US, versus multi-party systems as prevail in much of Europe.",920.44,950.89,34.720000000000006,T3-VlQu3iRM
254,"So let's go back to the comments I made about absolute and relative gains. I said to you that absolute gains are self-referential, as in the Ronald Reagan video that I put up saying ask yourself and I better off than I was four years ago. Relative gains are the sorts of things that Margaret Thatcher was lambasting in her speech in the House of Commons when she was saying that the left would rather that the poor will be poorer",956.93,992.16,36.63,T3-VlQu3iRM

So just for people who like diagrams, some people like diagrams and some don't, and there's nothing I'm gonna do with a diagram that you can't explain without a diagram. But for those who like diagrams, imagine you're gonna ask yourself which is better for me from the point of view of you representing the red dot. And we're thinking about my income on the vertical axis,",995.94,1024.64,33.7,T3-VlQu3iRM
256,"and her income on the horizontal axis. So just to be clear about what we're saying, with absolute gains anything above that line is better. I will be better off than I was four years ago if I can move above that line. When we're talking about relative gains, or other referential comparisons, then anything to the north-east of that, to the left side of that blue dotted line, I will be better off relative to her.",1031.1,1064.02,36.98,T3-VlQu3iRM
257,"And so we can think about four quadrants here, we can think about up here I'm better off either way, over here I'm worse off either way, here I am absolutely better off but relatively worse off, and here I'm relatively better off and absolutely worse off. So this is the difference. Now economists like to think in terms of absolute gains because they think in terms of win-win. So this is a close cousin of the Pareto principle, those that have taken Econ 101 will know,",1068.1,1103.81,37.769,T3-VlQu3iRM

If we move from here, maybe to here, maybe because the government taxes both of us and sends the money to a country we both despise then we're worse off. And these two quadrants are where one person gets better off and the other person gets worse off.",1107.046,1136.75,29.68,T3-VlQu3iRM
259,"And much of economic theory is about welfare economics is about whether and under what conditions we can say that the one who gains gains more or less than the one who loses. So the reason economists tend not to like relative comparisons is that there's no win-win with relative, there is no circumstance with relative comparisons where both people can be better off.",1138.9,1170.62,30.709,T3-VlQu3iRM
260,"And so I think that's a lot of the reason for the distaste for relative comparisons among neoclassical economists. But, this is not a course in neoclassical economics this is a course about power and politics in today's world. And when we think about power and politics we have to recognize that although economists tend to prefer absolute gains, relative gains are often much more potent in politics, people make relative comparisons whether our models tell us a good idea or not.",1174.377,1212.08,40.473,T3-VlQu3iRM

The example I gave is a college professor",1217.06,1251.75,32.992000000000004,T3-VlQu3iRM

And I'm gonna spend a lot more time on that topic today when we're thinking about the reorientation of left parties.

The reason is that where unions remain powerful within left of center parties they will pull them away from the median voter. So you saw this for example in the 1970s and 80s in the UK. Where unions were very powerful within the Labor Party, they controlled the leadership selection process for example, that's how Michael Foot became leader in 1980.",1865.58,1902.33,35.103,T3-VlQu3iRM

And so this idea of triangulation that was dreamt up by people like James Carville and others and very much also informed Tony Blair's approach in Britain.

So that is in a nutshell the story about why in two-party systems we saw this logic of triangulation most dramatically with Clinton and Tony Blair.

Because the argument on the other side is it's more representative at the electoral stage, but that doesn't mean it's more representative at the governing stage when governments have to be formed and coalition governments have to be put together.

So if we go back to what we were talking about, the median voter theorem a couple of lectures ago, the claim was, and the evidence seemed to support the proposition that multi-party systems are more redistributive",2825.505,2855.05,30.485,T3-VlQu3iRM
310,"because of what you would expect if you think that the people below the median voter would want more redistribution. As you can see, Bingham Powell's book was published in 2000. And that means that most of his data is at least several decades old now, it's all from the last century. But this picture of inequality that I showed you a while ago captures that intuition and that inequality went,",2857.85,2890.0,36.053,T3-VlQu3iRM
311,"this is the gilded age, this is today, we all know about the U-shaped curve that we went to much less inequality in the middle part of the century, and then since the 1970s it's been climbing. But then if you look by national, by country you can see that the U-shaped curve is flat in Germany and France than in the US and in the UK. So that's consistent with the suggestion",2895.422,2924.26,30.854,T3-VlQu3iRM
312,"that these systems are less inegalitarian, or less susceptible to inegalitarian outcomes then the two-party systems like Britain and the US. Of course for me to say that this graph supports that idea would be to commit to selecting on a dependent variable that I was talking about last time, so I'm not making a causal argument here. But this is just describing what was the conventional wisdom.",2928.55,2957.5290000000005,27.412999999999997,T3-VlQu3iRM
313,"And that's indeed why many people on the left prefer the European systems, they think that they are more likely to be egalitarian, more likely to be redistributive. So is it the case? And the thing that we have to start thinking about is that, Unions have also been declining in those systems. Now why might that matter? I put up a lot of graphs that would be too small to see, but basically you can see them when I post them.",2960.13,2994.46,37.092999999999996,T3-VlQu3iRM
314,"In virtually every single major European economy union membership has been declining in the last several decades, just as it has been declining in Britain and the US. Some at different rates. There are a couple of outliers, I mentioned Finland. Even in Finland in the last five years, union membership has fallen by 5%. And another outlier is Iceland,",3000.59,3028.01,26.903000000000006,T3-VlQu3iRM
315,"Iceland is a very tiny economy and it's not exactly clear why they have such high rates of unionization, but even in Iceland there's been a kind of backlash in one of the biggest unions just in the last couple of years, actually there's been a insurgency to take over control of the union because they feel it's too much of a company union, too close to the interests of the company's.",3030.04,3056.04,30.999999999999996,T3-VlQu3iRM
316,"So in any case, Iceland and Finland to one side, there's decline of unions everywhere for the reasons that we've talked about before. Namely, globalization of capital, that makes it easier for capital to move around. The exit costs for capital are low, the exit costs for labor are high, the Hershman story. And of course increasing, increasing jobs going to technology,",3063.0640000000003,3092.21,29.293,T3-VlQu3iRM
317,"that indeed may be more important than globalization going forward. A McDonald's restaurant that used to have 20 people working in it that you now see eight people working in it, five or eight years from now may have one person working in watching a robot making burgers. So we've seen this long term decline of union membership that's been going on everywhere pretty much.",3095.54,3120.7,24.744,T3-VlQu3iRM
318,"And that has two implications that I want to now dig into a little more deeply. The one implication is that left of center parties are gonna be less effective in protecting employed workers. So why might this be the case? I said unions protect their members. But the fewer members there are in an industry the less leverage the union has in negotiating settlements. You see this is going on right now, this isn't in a multi-party system,",3125.14,3161.585,34.596,T3-VlQu3iRM
319,"but you see this right now going on in Detroit. Why are those workers on strike, they are on strike or threatening to go on strike because the GM cannot compete with the foreign car makers working in southern states of the US, the so-called right to work states that are not unionized that are paying 30 bucks an hour, whereas the union agreement is more like 40 bucks an hour. So these unions are less powerful in negotiating with employers,",3164.44,3200.36,33.203,T3-VlQu3iRM
320,"GM could choose not to produce electric cars in Detroit and start producing them elsewhere. And so you would expect unions would be less able to negotiate strong deals. Whether or not it's part of the corporatist arrangement subsequently enforced by the government. So Germany, I said Germany was in the 80s was the heyday of what political economists were calling liberal corporatism, these big deals done between the big unions and big business",3202.11,3234.94,35.64,T3-VlQu3iRM
321,"and governments would get behind them. But in the early part of this century, interestingly when Gerhard Schroder as the last social Democratic chancellor was in a governing alliance with who? The Greens. Not a grand alliance with the CDU, but with the Green party. They implemented the so-called Hartz reforms, and the Hartz reforms were not that different",3239.18,3264.98,25.496000000000002,T3-VlQu3iRM
322,"from what was done by New Labour in the UK, and not that different from what was done under the Democrats in the US. The new Democrats under the US, there were market friendly reforms designed to reduce unemployment, to protect unemployment, reduce unemployment rather than protect workers wages. More market flexibility. Hartz, the author of the Hartz reforms",3267.97,3296.13,30.218999999999998,T3-VlQu3iRM
323,"had been head of Volkswagen, eventually actually resigned in disgrace a couple of years later for unrelated reasons, but he had designed these very business friendly reforms that were implemented over the first few years. There were four stages of them. In Germany their form of moving to the middle, so that the Social Democrats even when their only alliance partner was the Greens couldn't resist this tide.",3299.28,3331.24,32.28,T3-VlQu3iRM
324,"They were no longer in a position to force more generous settlements to their workers as they had been in the past. And by the way, even though Schroder implemented the Hartz reforms, it still didn't stop him from losing to Angela Merkel in the 2005 election, and she's been Chancellor of Germany ever since.",3333.63,3366.5,29.078999999999997,T3-VlQu3iRM
325,"So the move to the center, even in a multi-party system with a labor oriented party was in the driver's seat of the government was unable to do any better because of the declining power of the unions. And the other implication is that to the extent you can protect unionized workers, that may impose costs on others below the median income. Service sector workers who were notoriously difficult to organize",3372.381,3407.44,35.985,T3-VlQu3iRM
326,"even though these economies are all increasingly becoming service second economies, and the long-term unemployed. Because if you think about the union it's going to protect the short-term unemployed, namely their members who might recently have become unemployed and might be going back into the workforce, but they don't have an interest in protecting the long-term unemployed.",3410.5959999999995,3431.19,23.314,T3-VlQu3iRM
327,"On the contrary, there may be a trade-off between creating employment for the long-term unemployed and protecting the wages of unionized workers. So it's not surprising that even in multi-party systems you might think that unionized workers as represented by traditional left of center parties Are going to be less well protected and less effective as instruments of solidarity Among others whose income is below the median voter. So, how might this play out in a multi-party system?",3433.91,3481.2259999999997,39.133,T3-VlQu3iRM
328,"In a two-party system as I've said, the path of least resistance is to head for the middle and let the people on the flanks of your party stew. Multi-party systems are different because there are plenty of people to form coalitions with. And so this is, I should say that the slides that I'm gonna show you now are very much from work in progress that I'm doing with Francis Rosenberg and some economists, postdocs,",3483.18,3516.79,31.534,T3-VlQu3iRM
329,"that is somewhat tentative but there are some pretty dramatic conclusions I think on some matters. So you can see on here, this is from 1960 to 2020. 26 OECD countries, the vast majority of them multi-party systems. The number of parties represented in the legislature, the number of parties differs from the number of different effective partners, only in that effective parties weight them by their size.",3518.81,3551.77,33.453,T3-VlQu3iRM
330,"But what you can see is the number of parties in the legislature has gone up. We see fragmentation of political parties. And if you look at the left parties in these 26 OECD countries, what you can see is that while the voting share, which is the black line is pretty much flat, it's gone down a little bit since 2010. The number of parties has gone up dramatically. Why might that be?",3555.62,3592.3,30.986000000000004,T3-VlQu3iRM
331,"Why might we think, given what I've been talking about here, why would one think that we would start to see more parties, fragmentation just means more parties? Yeah, you're gonna have to yell, we forgot to get the microphone today. You'll have to scream. - [Man] If you move to the center then somebody can move to the left and take your left flank? - Bingo, that's exactly right.",3594.5959999999995,3614.087,22.454,T3-VlQu3iRM
332,"So just to give an example, the Social Democrats moved somewhat to the center. And alienated people on their left and those people then were up for grabs by other parties. It's not the case that they have no place to go. And so one possible cause of this is just another way of saying, what was said at the back of the room, that as industrial jobs have gone down. We can see here industrial jobs falling",3617.05,3654.22,34.117999999999995,T3-VlQu3iRM
333,"over this period quite dramatically, the number of parties has gone up. And so as these parties become weaker and represent fewer workers and therefore move in search of new coalition partners, other parties are gonna emerge because they can get some seats and they can get a place in the legislature. And it's interesting that if you look at fragmentation of right-wing parties",3656.55,3684.01,30.25,T3-VlQu3iRM
334,"there's no systematic shape, at least not since 1990s. If you try to draw a line through that it would be pretty much flat. So it's really more fragmentation on the left. And if you look here, where has the SPD's vote gone to? It's gone all over the place. So this is comparing, this is the 2013 election, the 2017 election in Germany. And you can see they have lost votes",3686.8,3716.04,25.494,T3-VlQu3iRM
335,"to the Alternative for Deutschland, they've lost votes to the Free Democrats, they've lost votes to the Greens, and they've also lost votes to people who stopped voting down here. So as the effects of the Hartz reforms and this move in the neoliberal direction in the SPD has accelerated, by 2013, by the way they were in a governing grand coalition with the CDU.",3717.77,3747.21,30.323,T3-VlQu3iRM
336,"So it was a very different kind of government. And many of their traditional supporters indeed thought that they had been selling out, giving away too much to Merkel to be in the coalition. And as I said to you in the very first lecture of the class, that in 2017 when they got hammered, they said we're not going back into another grand coalition because all we do is erode our base because of the agreements we have to make to be in a grand coalition",3751.4,3781.2090000000003,30.783,T3-VlQu3iRM
337,"with the CDU. And it was only after seven months of Merkel failing to make other coalition arrangements while the AFD was increasing its popularity in the polls, frightening everybody at the prospect of another election that the SPD finally went back into a grand coalition. It didn't help by the way, I mentioned to you in that lecture that the following year in the regional elections in Hesse and Bavaria",3785.3540000000003,3817.12,30.749,T3-VlQu3iRM
338,"that both the SPD and the CDU continued hemorrhaging support. Mostly the SPD to the Greens and mostly the CDU to the Alternative for Deutschland. Since then we've had local elections where the AFD has again cleaned up. So that is not gonna abate any time soon. So just again to, I don't want to talk about a lot of this but this again preliminary results.",3821.087,3851.73,31.058999999999997,T3-VlQu3iRM
339,"One of the things you see in that circle is that what might be, again this is not causally established, but what we're observing in this data. What might be the case that when left governments are in power as part of coalitions, unemployment actually has not gone up in these 26 OECD countries by about a percent. So again, this is not a causal argument,",3854.56,3886.87,31.566000000000003,T3-VlQu3iRM
340,but it's consistent with the thought that these left parties are less able to protect the people below the median voter. That they're protecting a shrinking labor aristocracy less and less effectively and with fewer and fewer positive spin-offs for people around and close to them in the income distribution. So the upshot of this is that unions in multi-party systems are protecting shrinking groups of industrial workers,3891.616,3928.18,36.089,T3-VlQu3iRM
341,"less well than they used to do. And party fragmentation makes solidaristic ideologies among voters below the median voter more difficult to sustain. And this is why we see the hemorrhaging of all of these voters on the slide I put up earlier. So just to finish out the German story, what happens is that as the SPD starts to lose voters, Merkel thinks oh, I could pick up some of these voters,",3931.57,3967.06,33.911,T3-VlQu3iRM
342,"so she also moved toward the middle. That then opened up space on her flank for the emergence of the Alternative for Deutschland party, and so to some extent fragmentation on the left will produce fragmentation on the right in response to that. And make it more difficult for parties on the right also to form predictable compilations. And so the sorts of outcomes we have been seeing in European elections in",3971.64,4006.91,32.6,T3-VlQu3iRM
343,"the last few years are not that surprising. Namely you get inconclusive results in many of these elections, or you get situations where you need three or four parties to form a government. And the traditional in Germany since we we're talking about Germany, traditionally in Germany the two biggest parties were the CDU and the SPD, and they were,",4008.53,4033.92,23.924999999999997,T3-VlQu3iRM
344,"it wasn't that different from a two-party system, it was very predictable that they were gonna dominate center-left and then center right, and then center-left were gonna dominate coalitions over time, so they operated more or less like two-party systems. Now all bets are off as to who will be in that coalition next time. Mostly because of the decline of center-left parties. And you can look in country after country after country",4035.76,4064.44,31.56,T3-VlQu3iRM
345,"where the left of center party traditionally always would come in first or second. It doesn't matter if it's Germany, it doesn't matter if it's Holland, it doesn't matter if it's Israel. The Labor Party in Israel always came in first or second. Now these parties come in fourth or fifth reflecting their much weakened state as representatives of organized labor within the electorate. So party fragmentation means",4068.0,4095.0,27.061,T3-VlQu3iRM
346,"that to the extent unions and the political parties that are answerable to unions are sources of solidarity of voters below the median voter, that has really gone away. And that means that even though it's a sort of commonly repeated mantra that PR systems are more redistributive, PR systems are more responsive to the median voter, the truth in today's world",4099.275,4129.692,31.128,T3-VlQu3iRM
347,"is that PR systems are simply vastly less predictable than they used to be, because of the proliferation of parties, nobody has any idea who is gonna be forming the government. And sometimes, so we have a grand coalition in Germany right now, but it could be parties from the two extremes as happened in the Greek elections of 2015.

So what I'm gonna do here is introduce an analytical schema from the social sciences, this is actually from a famous economist, a development economist by the name of Albert Hirschman who published this book ""Exit, Voice, and Loyalty"" in 1970. And he developed a framework for thinking about what happens when, as you can tell from the subtitle, firms, organizations, states, decline. How do people respond to decline.",1696.13,1731.68,36.779999999999994,f5nbT4xQqwI

And we will use Hirschman's framework at various points in the course. And so what is, he said, well if you think about yourself if a declining organization, there are three things you can do.",1734.44,1761.27,27.180000000000003,f5nbT4xQqwI
396,"One is, you can leave, exit. Two is you can complain and try and get it changed, voice. Three, you can try to fix it yourself. You believe in the cause and you want to make it better. And a lot of Hirschman's analysis says that what mix of exit, voice, and loyalty people engage in is determined by the costs of those things. So for instance, if you think about a public company. If you're a shareholder in a public company and you don't like the way it's being run,",1765.32,1802.68,37.756,f5nbT4xQqwI
397,"you can just sell your shares and buy shares in a different company that you like better, right? So you don't have much incentive to go to shareholders meetings and trying to get the company, you maybe think it's got too much debt or something, you just buy shares in a company that has less debt. That's all you need to do, just exit, very low cost of exit. So people are not gonna engage in voice. Now of course you might care about the company,",1805.07,1828.6,25.8,f5nbT4xQqwI
398,"it might be ostensibly a green company and you might be holding the shares in the company because of your commitment to green energy. Then you might feel loyalty to the company and you will want to try and get it changed. Think about yourself as a worker, working for a company. If you don't like the way the company is being run unlike a shareholder you can't just pick up and leave, you've got, you know, you live in this town, you've got your family,",1830.87,1862.59,30.393,f5nbT4xQqwI

So you're more likely to engage in voice, you're gonna go to meetings, you're gonna complain, you might form a union. You're gonna do things, or join a union. You're gonna do things to get the company to change its ways. So his book is an analysis of the ways in which exit, voice, and loyalty might be complementary",1863.6,1886.91,26.77,f5nbT4xQqwI
400,"in some circumstances, and might be competitors in some circumstances for the ways in which people respond to the decline of organizations. So the first thing to say about the Soviet Union in the 1980s and '90s is there was a substantial decline, almost disappearance of loyalty among both the elites and the citizens. And I got a firsthand view of this in March of 1991. There was a Yale delegate invited by the Communist Party",1890.37,1926.4,37.77,f5nbT4xQqwI

We are all afraid of what the KGB people might be doing to us, the first KGB person I ran into was trying to sell me currency at black market exchange rates.

And so here for example, a gentleman by the name of Rem Vyakhirev, who had also been a Soviet apparatchik, he'd been the Deputy Minister for oil and gas in the last years of the Soviet Union.

In comes Putin, and now we start to see",2915.47,2948.41,33.556,f5nbT4xQqwI
430,"a very different politics and economics emerging. And so what I want to do now is focus on how Yeltsin, how Yeltsin's oligarchs if you like, were rather different from what was coming down the pike. So what I've said so far is that the Soviet Union at the end of its years and certainly Russia in its first decade as a sovereign country, had a very weak state. The party had been strong and the state had been weak",2951.57,2987.33,32.477,f5nbT4xQqwI
431,"in the Soviet Union, but the party had essentially disintegrated. But I haven't defined my terms. So I probably should have done this earlier, but what do we mean when we talk about a state being a weak state, what makes a state weak? Yeah, you're gonna have to yell. - [Student] Lack of a rule of law? - Lack of the rule of law. That would be one symptom certainly of a weak state.",2989.877,3015.07,24.878999999999998,f5nbT4xQqwI

Any other signs of a weak state, yeah. Somebody's point, yeah. - [Student] Finances. - So one sign, yeah, of a weak state is that,",3018.82,3040.04,22.086000000000002,f5nbT4xQqwI
433,"an inability to tax. A low capacity to raise revenue. And the Russia that Putin inherited had a very, very bad tax system, very low enforcement. So for example, in the oil industry, which is the most important industry in the Soviet Union, they taxed output and exports, not profits because they didn't have the auditing capacity to see whether people, you know, profits are revenue minus costs,",3045.48,3078.86,33.303000000000004,f5nbT4xQqwI
434,"and they didn't have the capacity to audit, to stop companies from hiding profits. And so they would tax in a very inefficient way because that creates very bad incentives as well to innovate. So they didn't have the capacity to raise revenue very well, and indeed throughout the 1990s the oligarchs, led by Khodorkovsky by the way, had waged war on efforts by the Russian government",3081.92,3114.17,31.103,f5nbT4xQqwI
435,"to improve the capacity to tax. They had constantly lobbied for, and been successful in getting, the parliament not to improve the capacity to tax, and when Yeltsin came into power, in January of 2000, his first speech was mostly about taxation. He said that he was determined to reform the finances of the Soviet Union and he was going to completely reform the tax system, which he did.",3117.89,3148.48,30.435999999999996,f5nbT4xQqwI
436,"They had a very complex, multi-tiered system with huge deductions. He brought in a 13% flat tax, kept taxes low across the board with no exceptions, and he greatly simplified corporate taxation as well. So one of his big missions was to put Russia's fiscal house in order. And indeed, he partly got lucky because the price of oil went up, but they used a lot of that money,",3151.36,3178.47,29.24,f5nbT4xQqwI
437,"they created a sovereign wealth fund for a rainy day, knowing about the volatility of oil prices. And indeed, when the financial crisis finally hit, later in the decade, Russia was pretty well placed to weather that storm. So that's one thing that Putin did in the first decade of this century to try, and people thought at the time that he was strengthening the Russian state. But the other side of a weak state",3180.6,3211.7,30.853,f5nbT4xQqwI
438,"is the haphazard use of power. And by this I'm referring to the idea that when a government's capacity to enforce things is low, it has to compensate by being unpredictable. So for example, in a famous article about 18th century England, there were no police in 18th century England, they didn't get police until the 19th century. 1834, I believe, or 1832, somewhere around there. But if you look over the course",3214.1,3247.2,32.031,f5nbT4xQqwI
439,"of the 18th century in England, the number of capital offenses went up massively. You could be hanged for being a pickpocket. But the number of executions remained constant. They didn't actually execute more people. So basically what would happen is that the assizes would come into town, they would string up a few people, and then they'd go off to the next parish. Because that was the only capacity that they had,",3248.97,3275.34,27.233000000000004,f5nbT4xQqwI
440,"so there's a kind of trade off. But one symptom of, one symptom of a weak state, is the haphazard and often dramatic use of power in this way. And anyone who's read Foucault's ""Discipline and Punish"" the opening pages of a gory execution of somebody on the scaffold is again an illustration not of a strong state, but of a weak state. Again, when you see the Egyptian government sentencing hundreds of people to death on one day,",3277.85,3310.09,32.999,f5nbT4xQqwI
441,"almost none of whom end up being executed, it's a sign of a weak state, not a strong state. So haphazard use of power. And you look at Putin's early moves, and they underscore this. The most important thing he did was he took down Khodorkovsky. Khodorkovsky by then was the most wealthy Russian oligarch. Owner of Yukos, and Putin threw him in prison.",3313.44,3343.79,28.133,f5nbT4xQqwI
442,"He was charged with various forms of fraud and eventually, when he'd already been in prison for about a year he was finally sentenced to nine years of imprisonment.

Nobody thought that Putin would have the temerity or the capacity to do this, but because of his KGB background, he had been a KGB officer in East Germany before he came back to the new Russia,",3348.84,3379.44,32.877,f5nbT4xQqwI
443,"he was able to do that. And then not only did he throw, not only did he throw Khodorkovsky in prison, he basically seized back through a complex transaction, which I'm not gonna describe, much of Yukos, and claimed it for Rosneft, the state oil company. And then he took down Vyakhirev, who, as I said to you earlier,",3382.72,3419.55,29.187,f5nbT4xQqwI

So",3458.38,3490.06,28.683,f5nbT4xQqwI

Maybe the right wing governments in say in Britain and the US, or the fact that power in Germany had now shifted as I already said from the social democrats to the CDU, maybe it would shift back.

499,"is that the social democratic economies and welfare states depended on a very fortuitous arrangement of demographic, economic, and geopolitical circumstances after the war. The demographic one was that you had big working age populations relative to what we call dependent populations. We think of the dependency ratio is the ratio of working age to dependent. And dependent is defined under the age of 15",1012.91,1042.82,32.494,q53DF6ySOZg

And of course, what really matters from the point of view of the fiscal health of the welfare state is the older crowd because parents mostly internalize the cost of children whereas governments in turn have to bear the cost of elderly people.

So the idea that European social democracy",1107.69,1146.8,37.31999999999999,q53DF6ySOZg
503,"was sort of a permanent equilibrium was by no means obvious. It's certainly not in retrospect. A second thing to notice is that while the bogeymen of Communism might not have been there around which the Conservative, the ideological right could organize, there are always other potential bogeymen and particularly as it's turned out since 9/11, Islamic fundamentalism is an alternative bogeyman around which to organize political movements",1150.28,1178.7,32.489999999999995,q53DF6ySOZg

You know, when Islamist regimes, when Islamists do come to power whether it's in Iran or Libya under Gaddafi, they run capitalist systems badly. There's no alternative. There's no Islamist model of the economy. So the idea that one has to worry about them as a threat to capitalism",1182.77,1214.99,28.797000000000004,q53DF6ySOZg

506,We had 20% unemployment. There was real fear in the aftermath of the Depression that Communism might claim hearts and minds of large numbers of American workers and that is partly what motivated business elites and others to at least tacitly support the new deal. The notion was that you want to make sure America's workers do not reach a state of affairs where they think they have nothing to lose but their chains. And so my colleague Peter Swenson,1243.47,1284.36,39.55500000000001,q53DF6ySOZg
507,"has done tremendous scholarship on this, but actually what Swenson shows is that there's never been significant expansion of a welfare state, even the European welfare states by the way, without significant at least tacit and sometimes active support from business. And part of it in the '30s and '40s was Keynesian thinking about revising the economy or proto-Keynesian thinking. The general theory didn't come out",1287.185,1317.005,30.988000000000003,q53DF6ySOZg
508,"until well after the Depression, but there were many people making those kinds of arguments at the time. But it was also political. It was this idea that you want to give the dispossessed people who had been most harmed by the Depression a stake in the existing order. And similar arguments were made in Britain and Europe. For instance, Ralph Miliband,",1319.52,1345.87,27.208,q53DF6ySOZg

And so this was the notion that if you don't do this, there's an alternative model out there vying for hearts and minds and we'd better look out for that. Once the alternative model has gone away, once there's no longer a Soviet Union, it's much easier to discount all of that.

It's not obvious that there's any reason of the sort that existed when there was a Communist alternative out there to continue to maintain expensive welfare states that would require substantial levels of taxation and maybe increasing levels of taxation given the changes in the demography. So the short of it is that those who had faith in the idea",1412.02,1443.15,34.028,q53DF6ySOZg

But I want now to turn to some more analytical thinking. Let's put on my analytical hat here. Some more analytical thinking about the logic of distributive politics because I think people don't think clearly enough,1448.402,1475.01,30.281,q53DF6ySOZg
513,"about just what that logic is when they think about what's gonna happen in different political scenarios. So this is a famous picture of a hat from the beginning of ""The Little Prince,"" Antoine de Saint-Exupery. And as you might recall, it's the very beginning of the book. He decides he wants to frighten the adults and he's gonna frighten the adults",1479.18,1507.0479999999998,29.711999999999996,q53DF6ySOZg

Now, one thing we can know about this story is that the adults he was trying to frighten were not economists because had they been economists, he might have been able to frighten them with this picture because instead of not seeing, instead of seeing it as a hat, they might have seen it as a picture of the income distribution.",1540.13,1565.2,27.083,q53DF6ySOZg

So that means that in every, you know, obviously there's a cut off point here because there's some level below which people won't survive, but the very rich people pull up the average",1596.64,1616.757,23.203000000000003,q53DF6ySOZg

And so this had for a long time led political economists to think that politicians who are trying to win election will be responsive the median voter and there'd sorta be a kind of impetus to redistribute downwardly because politicians need votes, they need to get elected, and so they will do that. This median voter is gonna be below the mean income.",1620.08,1654.56,31.431,q53DF6ySOZg

And so once you put a second dimension into play, if you like, it's no longer the case that the median voter will necessarily want downward redistribution because they may want preservation of their racial status quo more. And so this is one of the ways in which scholars.",1938.25,1965.64,28.947,q53DF6ySOZg
529,"My colleague in the Political Science Department, John Roemer has developed a number of these models that show this. Once you put a second dimension whether it, I'm just putting race here.

Women may think the pro-choice pro-life dimension",1969.91,1990.64,24.853,q53DF6ySOZg

So that's one possible story about why we have not seen the sorts of developments that one might anticipate. Here's another story. So this is what game theorists refer to as the majority rule divide a dollar game. And here, the intuition is",1998.06,2033.94,30.106,q53DF6ySOZg
531,"that if you divide a dollar by majority rule, no matter how you divide it, there is some potential majority to upset that division. So if you think if they start out with an equal division, you can see here that Stannis and Arya can decide to completely dispossess Joffrey and keep it all to themselves. But of course, if we think of things going around over time, then what if Joffrey's gonna come along to Arya and say, ""I'll offer you a different deal.",2036.1,2079.45,35.52,q53DF6ySOZg

535,"that I mentioned to you last week. And notice here I'm not just talking about interests as selfish. For example, the three people playing the divided dollar game. Maybe one wants to give the money to save the whales. One wants to give the money to soup kitchens and one wants to spend it protecting wolves as my friend Nicoly up there would probably want to do. So they try to maximize their share of the pie,",2177.7,2206.34,31.453,q53DF6ySOZg

So what we're really saying is in order for the median voter to achieve downward redistribution, all these people have to vote together. All of these people to the left of this line",2239.77,2268.53,28.728,q53DF6ySOZg

540,"Maybe you can motivate them with that. So here's the next question is well, what is fairness? Well, here's one answer to that. - So a final experiment that I want to mention to you is our fairness study. So what we did is we put two Capuchin monkeys side by side. Again, these animals, they live in a group. They know each other. We take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber.

The law is very explicit.,3793.23,3814.86,24.125999999999998,q53DF6ySOZg

That is the spoken and unspoken hope and wish of millions of our fellow citizens. - So those two confrontations were emblematic of the gloves coming off with the rise of the new right when Ronald Reagan fired the air traffic controllers in 1981 and Margaret Thatcher took on the miners who had been striking through much of the 1970s in Britain,3899.115,3934.73,35.738,q53DF6ySOZg
592,"and broke the miner's union. And this signaled a start of a very different attitude toward unions on the part of right of center parties. And many people sort of date the big change here to those governments and those particular sort of symbolic confrontations. But the truth is that that was the tip of an iceberg that has a much longer provenance. So if you look at union membership in the US, you can see this starts from, goes from 1973 to 2009,",3940.13,3975.1290000000004,39.565,q53DF6ySOZg

595,"is really in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Wagner Act protecting unions had been passed in 1935 as part of FDR's new deal legislation and had had very tepid opposition from business initially partly because of the fears of Communism, but that rapidly changed once it became obvious that the US economy was not gonna disappear, was not gonna collapse. And through much of the 1940s,",4042.1079999999997,4076.954,33.191,q53DF6ySOZg
596,"there was a lot of lobbying to either get rid of Wagner or cut it back. And in 1947, Republican Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act which over President Truman's veto by the way, so it was a very powerful Republican Congress did that, takes 2/3 in both houses, and Taft-Hartley cut back on a lot of union protections. So part of it was the politics, but we've seen as America has transformed from a manufacturing to a services economy,",4079.325,4111.465999999999,35.442,q53DF6ySOZg
597,"it's become less and less unionized partly for those sorts of political reasons and part because it's much harder to organize service sector than it is manufacturing, and mining, and things like that, and partly because more recently, the advent of free trade.

598,"so capital can leave at much lower cost than labor. Think about what I said about different exit costs being important when we talked about Hirschman. And those exit costs for capital have come down, and down, and down, and so we saw last time if they can't make enough money in China, they just move to Vietnam. And then they'll go to Cambodia or some place else. So you've got low exit cost for capital,",4147.82,4172.9,27.61,q53DF6ySOZg

And this as somebody said when we were talking about, this has a lot to do, the red line there is a share of the income going to the top 10% and the blue line is the decline in unionization since the '50s. And as you can see, as unions get smaller and smaller,",4175.43,4200.73,27.174,q53DF6ySOZg

614,"it's an alliance, but it it has an institutional presence. So this second lens focuses on institutional arrangements which may or may not be consistent with the way people's interests line up, right? So for instance, George Kennan, who I mentioned to you last time, thought the United Nations was a waste of time because countries always behave in their interests and if the UN told them to do something that wasn't in their interest, they would ignore it.",251.53,276.97,28.470000000000002,s48b9B5gd88

Rosa Luxemburg is famous for saying, the rivers of history run through the most finely meshed statute.
